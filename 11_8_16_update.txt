Today we focused on a tutorial located here https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial

I didn't bother typing it in as we were going because we were all working on it at the same time

It was the first resource that really helped us understand how we can connect the jhipster backend to the 
react native front end.
